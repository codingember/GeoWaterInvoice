# GeoWaterInvoice

I developed a streamlined solution that automates the creation and delivery of client proposal PDFs, accelerating the sales process and enhancing operational efficiency. The automated system uses Google Cloud for generating client proposals, integrating water mapping and invoicing into a seamless workflow. The Python script, `GeoWaterInvoice.py`, outputs `invoice.pdf`, `map.html`, and `map.pdf` all generated in sequence from a single file.
