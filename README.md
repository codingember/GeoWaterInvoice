# GeoWaterInvoice
I created an automated system using Google Cloud for generating client proposals, integrating water mapping and invoicing into a seamless workflow. 
The Python script, `GeoWaterInvoice.py`, outputs `invoice.pdf`, `map.html`, and `map.pdf` all generated in sequence from a single file.
